This directory contains files to build the R interfaces
to the functions of V2.3 SPAMS library already interfaced with matlab.

WARNING : the API of spams.OMP and spams.OMPMask has changed since version V2.2

-------------------------------------------------
tar zxf spams-R.tar.gz
cd spams-R
# rlib=install-directory
export R_LIBS=$rlib
R CMD INSTALL --html -l $R_LIBS spams

This should work on linux and MacOS.
However, if you have undefined symbols, you can add extra libraries
by modifying, in spams/src/Makevars the line
EXTRA_LIBS=

# tests
Note : to run test_TrainDL and test_TrainDL_Memory you need the R package png
     (a version of this package can be found in the current directory).

We suppose that environment variable R_LIBS is set:
cd $R_LIB/spams/test
Rscript test_spams.R -help
Rscript test_spams.R

Warning : for now the R interface is only available for a subset of the functions
	described in the documentation of SPAMS.
toolbox linalg : all functions
toolbox decomp : spams.sparseProject spams.lasso spams.lassoMask spams.lassoWeighted spams.omp spams.ompMask
toolbox prox : spams.fistaFlat spams.fistaTree spams.proximalFlat spams.proximalTree
toolbox dictLearn : spams.TrainDL spams.TrainDL_Memory

# Notes:
As the C++ interface is built by Swig, I must add
dummy documentations for 3 class S4 methods
(I could not avoid warnings in R CMD check).
If you have a version of R lower than 2.13, there will remain
one warning with R CMD check, because SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS must be manually defined.
